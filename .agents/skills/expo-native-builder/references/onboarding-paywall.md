# Expo onboarding, plan, and paywall flow

Use this reference for onboarding, personalization, attribution, rating, permissions, pledge moments, generated plans, paywalls, and optional offers. The user's named screens and implementation plan always override the default below.

## Default when the request is vague

When a user asks for an app with onboarding but gives no journey, propose and implement a product-specific version of:

`welcome/proof -> useful questions -> responsive teaching and product demonstration -> personal calculation/visualization -> attribution -> earned rating moment -> contextual permissions -> fingerprint-style pledge -> signed-oath congratulations -> plan building -> detailed personalized plan (congratulations) -> contextual paywall -> optional eligible offer -> activation`

Adapt every beat to the product. A calorie tracker should ask only questions that change calorie targets, nutrition guidance, pacing, recommendations, or the final plan; demonstrate the product with believable calorie-tracking UI; then reuse those answers throughout the calculation, pledge, plan, and paywall.

Do not force the default when the user supplies a desired flow, screen list, design, or implementation plan. Follow their sequence and omissions exactly. Remove a default module when it is irrelevant, unsupported, unsafe, or conflicts with the product.

## Choose the welcome from the product

Default to one clear promise, one strong visual or product preview, one primary action, and a returning-user action when relevant. Choose the composition independently when no approved design exists:

| Pattern | Use when |
|---|---|
| Brand or mascot | Character and familiarity help establish trust or explain the journey. |
| Product preview | Seeing the actual result or interaction explains the value fastest. |
| Photography and outcome | The product benefits from a relatable activity or aspiration. |
| Illustration and typography | A narrative or emotional concept needs a distinctive visual. |
| Minimal promise | The job is clear and extra education adds little. |
| Authentication first | Account access is necessary immediately for the requested journey. |

A carousel, gradient, mascot, and social proof are optional. If a carousel is useful, give each panel a distinct lesson and retain accessible manual navigation. Ask for missing artwork early using the asset guidance in `SKILL.md`.

## Pace it as a conversation

Implement monetized onboarding as one shared-state conversational funnel: store each answer, derive later screens and paywall content from it, and recompute dependent data when answers change.

Use `ask -> react -> teach -> reveal -> commit` as rhythm, not a mandatory screen list.

- Keep one idea and one primary action per screen.
- Never place more than two genuine asks together without feedback, teaching, or payoff.
- Make every answer change a later choice, copy, calculation, recommendation, visual, plan, or route.
- Reuse answers visibly and clear dependent answers when an earlier choice changes.
- Ramp effort from taps to limited typing, deliberate pledge, and payment only after value.
- Use a moving progress bar or honest phase progress; never display a misleading `Step N of M`.

Keep direct answers, derived values, recommendations, and visible consequences separate. Make calculations pure so Back and edits recompute the journey correctly. Keep believable prototype formulas and claims in one replaceable fixture. Populate every designed chart, forecast, plan date, recommendation, rating, testimonial, and result so the UI is complete and testable; never leave the surface blank because production data is missing.

For welcome screens, follow the user's composition or choose from the product and references; never force a fixed ratio. Support full-bleed, hero-heavy, a larger rounded bottom panel, curved/split surfaces, or overlapping layers, with optional gradients and single/layered shadows. Keep `identity -> visual -> promise -> primary action -> optional secondary action`, safe-area aware and compact-screen responsive.

## Route and component structure

Use `/onboarding/[step]` when the questions share a shell and need route-derived progress and Back behavior. Validate the route key and redirect unknown values safely. Give distinctive transition/result screens named routes when that keeps their composition clear.

`[step].tsx` should contain only route parsing, resolved step/progress, shared chrome, navigation, and `<StepRenderer />`. Put step data in `src/components/onboarding/steps.ts` and substantial bodies in focused files such as:

```text
src/components/onboarding/
|-- step-renderer.tsx
|-- select-step.tsx
|-- text-step.tsx
|-- product-preview-step.tsx
|-- rating-step.tsx
|-- permission-step.tsx
|-- pledge-step.tsx
|-- progress-bar.tsx
|-- steps.ts
`-- state.tsx
```

Group small related bodies when that is clearer; do not create a file for trivial markup. The goal is a readable, testable route—not maximum file count.

Use the smallest state container that supports the flow. Persist only when unfinished onboarding must survive termination. Do not add Zustand, AsyncStorage, authentication, or a backend automatically.

## Attribution, rating, and permissions

Ask “Where did you hear about us?” only when acquisition attribution is useful. Keep it skippable and separate from App Tracking Transparency.

Place the rating moment after an earned positive beat, not near the start. A designed social-proof screen and the native store-review request are different. The OS owns its review UI and may show nothing; progression must never depend on it.

Request notifications, health, tracking, photos, camera, or other permissions only when the product uses them. Explain the immediate benefit before invoking the native prompt, then handle granted, denied, restricted, and can-ask-again states. Continue without optional permissions and offer a Settings path when useful.

## Fingerprint pledge and signed result

When a suitable pledge or personal commitment asks the user to hold, default to a bottom-centred circular control with a fingerprint icon unless the user requests another treatment. Drive the hold and transition from one Reanimated progress value: grow the circle from beneath the finger until it covers the furthest screen corner, reverse it on early release, and complete into a destination already painted the same colour so no cut or stranded overlay remains. This is a visual commitment gesture, not biometric authentication or Touch ID. Adapt or omit it when a hold interaction does not suit the product; do not add a transition dependency when the installed motion stack can implement it cleanly.

Provide visible hold progress, an accessible tap/activation alternative, and a plain button or short fade under Reduce Motion. Never use the hold as legal consent, account authentication, payment confirmation, or the only path through an irreversible action.

After completion, reveal a concise product-specific congratulations screen confirming that the user signed their pledge or oath. Say “oath,” “pledge,” or the approved product term—never “OAuth.” Reuse their name, goal, and chosen commitment. This signed result is a motivational state, not a legal signature. Celebrate once with restrained motion/haptics, then continue to plan building.

## Plan building and detailed result

Plan building must prove the app listened. Show 3–5 truthful checkpoints that connect collected answers to decisions. Support pending, complete, error, retry, and a useful fallback. Do not fake remote work; use a short honest reveal when generation is immediate.

When complete, reveal “Your plan is ready” or a product-specific congratulations before the result. The detailed plan should appear before the paywall and synthesize real earlier answers rather than showing a generic summary. It may include:

- plan title and personalized promise;
- answer evidence and derived target;
- rules or recommendations and why they were chosen;
- first-week path or milestones;
- calculations, chart, forecast, or progress visualization;
- preview of the real product experience;
- edit action and a clear CTA into the commercial decision.

Use one scroll container for a long result and keep the CTA reachable. The CTA commits to viewing/starting the plan; it must not imply that a purchase happened.

## Paywall and optional offer

Carry one plan title, metric, chart, image, or artifact from the result into the paywall. Default the primary paywall to a focused single viewport with close, Restore, one value story, plan selection, purchase CTA, billing disclosure, and legal actions.

When the task is UI-only or the store catalog is not connected, create one believable representative catalog fixture and render it fully: plan names, monthly/yearly amounts, billed totals, trial length, due-today amount, charge date, renewal cadence, savings, selected plan, and offer values when designed. The user must be able to see and test the complete decision. Do not present fixture IDs, prices, eligibility, or checkout as production-connected.

Closing the paywall goes to the declared free/exit destination or one approved eligible offer. The offer must address a different objection, show exact price/cadence/renewal, avoid invented scarcity, appear once per decision journey, and provide a visible decline that leaves the funnel.

Keep purchase pending/cancel/error/success and restore states explicit. Store-sheet cancellation is a quiet return. Never claim entitlement before confirmation.

## Choose one paywall story

Use the product's value and the user's current context to choose a primary pattern; these are alternatives, not sections to combine automatically:

| Pattern | Composition and behavior |
|---|---|
| Feature comparison | Concise free/paid differences with a stable comparison layout; tier selection updates the relevant benefits and billing. |
| Personalized outcome | Carry the user's goal, result, or plan into a focused hero; make the unlocked value specific. |
| Trial timeline | Explain today, any supported reminder, and the charge date in reading order. Never promise a reminder the app cannot deliver. |
| Simple plan choice | A short value statement and clearly differentiated options; selection updates the full billed amount and cadence together. |
| Product or mascot hero | One memorable visual demonstrates the benefit; keep its motion separate from stable purchase controls. |
| Bundle | Explain the included products and combined value before showing the relevant plans. |

A single viewport is a default, not a reason to shrink text or clip disclosures. Allow scrolling on compact screens, with large text, or when the approved value story needs it; keep the CTA reachable without covering terms. When there is no preceding onboarding result, use the current feature or upgrade context instead of inventing a personalized plan.

Do not copy a reference's ratings, promised outcomes, discounts, countdowns, or multiple-offer sequence. Use verified production values or the declared representative fixture. A selected plan is not a purchase; cancellation returns quietly to the current selection. Verify close/decline, Restore, billing updates, and any eligible-offer exit independently of animation.

## Background and internal content motion

Always set the nested onboarding and connected paywall Stack to `animation: "none"`. Routes do not slide, crossfade, or animate as whole screens. Keep shared progress, state, and any approved background mounted in the layout.

Animate content inside each arriving screen. Reveal the illustration, headline, copy, options, derived metrics, plan checkpoints, detailed sections, carried paywall artifact, and CTA in a deliberate reading order. Interactive controls must not remain visually offset from their hit boxes. Under Reduce Motion, render the final content immediately or with a very short opacity change.

Background treatment is a design decision. Use a plain semantic surface, image-led scene, or restrained gradient based on the product, user request, reference, and existing design system. Do not add a gradient merely because the flow includes onboarding or a plan.

## Verify the complete journey

Test resolved paths, answer edits, Back/forward behavior, invalid routes, progress, calculations, rapid taps, keyboard, permissions, pledge cancellation/completion, Reduce Motion, plan failure/retry, detailed result continuity, compact screens, paywall close, offer decline, purchase/restore states, and final activation. Report every representative formula, rating, testimonial, attribution event, price, trial, charge date, offer, permission, analytics event, or backend contract awaiting a production source, then ask whether the user wants those fixtures connected to the real backend/store products next.

## Clean result and coordinated purchase phase

For a personalized journey, the adaptable sequence is `pledge -> commitment confirmation -> building -> plan result -> paywall -> optional eligible offer`. Preserve an approved alternative. Building resolves actual checkpoints and leads to a visible result; do not jump directly from a spinner to pricing or copy prototype timers as production work.

Make the result a clean, scrollable explanation of what the user will do and receive:

1. Product-specific artwork, personalized outcome headline, and a clear plan-ready confirmation.
2. A compact target or explanation connecting the plan to earlier answers.
3. Meaningful stages or weeks: short title, concrete action, expected benefit stated honestly, and a small illustration when useful. Derive the stages from the product, not a mandatory four-week template.
4. A concise first action or product preview and optional edit action.
5. One reachable CTA into the paywall; its label reflects that the plan is already built and does not imply payment.

Use varied section hierarchy, generous spacing, and restrained milestone surfaces; avoid rendering every answer as an equally prominent card. Reveal sections once as they become visible, preserve reading position, and keep a pinned CTA clear of content and the home indicator. Ask for coordinated hero/milestone artwork when missing.

The result can introduce a new visual phase after a quieter opening journey. Define explicit background/foreground tokens per phase: opening, commitment fill/confirmation, and result/purchase. The result and paywall should share a background family, artwork style, typography, and one personalized artifact; an offer may vary emphasis within that family. Persistent layout does not mean an identical background colour on every route: render the destination's phase without a blank frame or whole-screen route animation. Follow exact approved phase colours when provided. Do not automatically add gradients, countdowns, discount blocks, or a second sales story to the result.
